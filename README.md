## :runner: Getting started

**You need to install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/).**

Follow the steps bellow:

```bash
# Open a terminal and copy this repository with the command
$ git clone https://github.com/Mateussv/Foodfy.git.

# Enter the directory with
$ cd foodfy

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Create the database and tables using the commands
# included in the "database.sql" file

# Database connection:
# Open and edit the "db.js" file inside the "src/config" folder
# with your Postgres user and password.

# Populate the database using the file "seed.js":
$ node seed.js

# Run the application:
$ npm start
```

**Important:** Do not delete or change the placeholder image directly from the `public/images' folder, as the revenues and chefs generated by `seed.js` share these files with each other. However, you can delete them from the administrative area of the site.

<br>

### Access to the administrative area

Select an email from the users table, access the login screen and enter using it with the password "1111" (default password).

Note: administrator users have the "ADMIN" badge in their header:

### Creating New Users and Password Recovery
To use these features, edit the mailer.js file inside the scr/lib folder with your credentials.
